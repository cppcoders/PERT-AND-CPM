# Introduction


This is a R program that takes an activity table whether it is a CPM or a PERT and and proccess it to find the critical path (along with some other calculations in the PERT method )

The Project Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) and Critical Path Method (CPM)  were developed by management scientists to help organizations with planning,  scheduling and controlling large projects,such as building a new hospital orlaunching a  newproduct.

large projects has serie sof interdependent activities that take time to complete,require  funds and resources, such as time andlabor.

Interdependence means that activities follow a given sequence orprecedence  relationship -some activities cannot start until others are completed.

**Steps :** </br>
- Step 1. Identify theactivities</br>
- Step 2. Determine activity relationships (immediate predecessors of eachactivity)</br>
- Step 3. Estimate activity completion times andcosts</br>
- Step 4. Construct an activitynetwork</br>
- Step 5. Execute a forward pass to determine earliest start and earliest finish times for each activity, and project completion time </br>
- Step 6. Execute a backward pass to determine latest start and latest finish times for each activity</br>
- Step 7. Identify activity slack (length of time an activity can be delayed without delaying  the project completiontime)</br>
- Step 8. Find the activities with zero slack; these are critical activities and make up at  least one critical path</br>
- Step 9. Use information from Steps 5 -8 to develop the activity schedule for the project.</br>
- Step 10. Find project completion time variance and conduct probability analysis, suchas  the probability of meeting a customer target completion time, under the condition of  uncertainty in activity times.</br>
- Step 11. Consider time-cost tradeoffs</br>
- Step 10. Implement, monitor and control the project.</br>

## 1- Critical Path Method

### The critical path method, or critical path analysis, is an algorithm for scheduling a set of project activities. It is commonly used in conjunction with the program evaluation and review technique.

**Steps :**
 -   takes an activity table with each activity's titel, immediate predecessor(s) and time and stores it into a graph
 -   using a modified Breadth First Search algorithm to traverse the graph to find the forward and backward path
 -   in the forward path it calculates the ES (Early Start time) and EF (Early Finish time ) of each activity
 -   in the backward path it calculates the LS (Late Start time ) and LF (Late Finish time ) of each activity
 -   calculate the slack value of each activity 

        ES (Early Start Time)  = maximum value of "EF" for all the activities it depends on  
        EF (Early Finish Time) = ES + Activity time  
        LF (Late Finish Time) = minimum value of "LS" for all the activites that depends on this activity 
        LS (Late Start Time ) = LF - Activity time  
        S (Slack Value) = LS - ES of each activity, if it's zero then this activity is in the critical path 
 -   draws a plot showing the graph, the attributes for each node and the critical path (green nodes),

 **Here is Some Sample Tests And It's Output**

## 2- PERT method 

### PERT is a scheduling technique that was specifically designed by the Navy in 1958for  projects with uncertain activitytimes.

**Steps :** </br>
- Takes an activities table as follow (Activity - Title  - Immediate Predecessor - Optimistic Time - Most probable Time - Pessimistic Time ) 
- Finds the Expected Time for each activity by : expected_time(a) = ( Optimistic Time + 4 * Most probable Time + Pessimistic Time ) / 6
- Finds the variance of each activity by : variance(a) = (Pessimistic Time - Optimistic Time ) ^ 2 / 36 
- sends the modified table to CPM function to find the critical path 
- Find mean which is the sum of Expected Times of critical path activities 
- Finds the total variance which is the sum of Variance o critical path activities 
- Finds the standard deviation which is the square root of variance 
- Finds the probabilty to finish the project on a specific Time 

 
 **Here is Some Sample Tests And It's Output**

| Activity | Immediate Prodecessor | Optimistic Time | Most probable Time | Pessimistic Time |
| -------- | ---------------------  | -------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
|A|-|6|9|12|
|B|A|3|4|11|
|C|A|2|5|14|
|D|B-C|4|6|8|
|E|C|1|1.5|5|
|F|E|5|6|7|
|G|D|7|8|15|
|H|B|1|2|3|
